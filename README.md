# Djanky BlackJack
Djanky BlackJack is a janky blackjack implementation in django. It is 
self-explanatory. This was my final project for the week-long 
TRACE sponsored django bootcamp.

The long-term goal for this project is to implement sockets for handling the 
games. When that is completed, a link will be provided.

* Janky things
  1. No use of sockets, but forced page reloads
  2. Too many variables, clunky models
  
* Other details
  * Uses materialize for styling
